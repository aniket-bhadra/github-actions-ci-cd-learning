### What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a platform to **automate developer workflows**.

One common example is **CI/CD**, but GitHub Actions can automate many other workflows, such as:

* **Testing** – Automatically run tests on code.
* **Scheduled Tasks** – Run scripts at set times (e.g., daily backups).
* **Code Formatting** – Auto-fix code style issues.

### How does GitHub Actions automate these workflows?

GitHub Actions works by responding to **GitHub events** — things that happen in or to your repository (e.g., a pull request is created, a contributor joins, a PR is merged).

You can:

* **Listen to specific events**.
* **Trigger workflows** automatically based on those events.

Each workflow is a series of actions (like sorting, labeling, assigning, etc.) that are executed **automatically** after a specific event.

This entire process is called a **workflow**.
